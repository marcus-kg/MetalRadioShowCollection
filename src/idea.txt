newer idea
At least since it is possible to add strings for programs to excute, the call string in the /etc/crontab is too log again.
solution: One config file in the /etc directory to set some pathes and programs to execute.
Splited into sections the first section is global and could be overridden in mrscf-file.spcific sections below.


new idea
The string to call the recordradio.sh scipt ist too long.
- i could write a script that takes the textfile as one argumet
  and the recording directory as an otherone because this does not belong to the collection file.
- another script could handle the time zone recalculation of the crontabsring 
metalrecorder.pl -f /home/marcus/src/MetalRadioShowCollection/tinnitus.txt -d /home/marcus/radioshows
reCalcCronString.pl tinnitus.sh

old idea
write a script that can read the txt files and creare a string to appaend at crontab
with recalculation of radiostation timezone and own timezone.

use it like this:
<NAME_OF_SCRIPT> a_radioshow.txt 5 >> /etc/crontab
