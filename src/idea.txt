manage timezone summertime chaos

get localtime, offset utc isotime ... via long and lat
http://www.earthtools.org/timezone-1.1/50.1109221/8.3267853
if the recording starts 1 (maybe 2) houres befor it should, than one can ask this server for the real-time
and wait one (or 2) houres


write an installer

check if everything is available
    streamripper
    read, write permission to /etc/ /home/...
create a dir at /home/.../ to record into
backup existing /etc/Metal...
create cofing file in /etc/ with correct setted pathes
crontab:
    backup crontab
    delete all existing metalrecorder lines
    append lines for each found *.mrscf file
restart cron


newer idea
At least since it is possible to add strings for programs to excute, the call string in the /etc/crontab is too log again.
solution: One config file in the /etc directory to set some pathes and programs to execute.
Splited into sections the first section is global and could be overridden in mrscf-file.spcific sections below.


new idea
The string to call the recordradio.sh scipt ist too long.
- i could write a script that takes the textfile as one argumet
  and the recording directory as an otherone because this does not belong to the collection file.
- another script could handle the time zone recalculation of the crontabsring 
metalrecorder.pl -f /home/marcus/src/MetalRadioShowCollection/tinnitus.txt -d /home/marcus/radioshows
reCalcCronString.pl tinnitus.sh

old idea
write a script that can read the txt files and creare a string to appaend at crontab
with recalculation of radiostation timezone and own timezone.

use it like this:
<NAME_OF_SCRIPT> a_radioshow.txt 5 >> /etc/crontab
