new idea
The string to call the recordradio.sh scipt ist too long.
i could write a script that takes the textfile as one argumet
and the recording directory as an otherone because this does not belong to the file.


old idea
write a script that can read the txt files and creare a string to appaend at crontab
with recalculation of radiostation timezone and own timezone.

use it like this:
<NAME_OF_SCRIPT> a_radioshow.txt 5 >> /etc/crontab
